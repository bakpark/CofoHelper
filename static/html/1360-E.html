The soldiers placed a       cannon above each cell in the first row and a cannon to the left       of each cell in the first column. Thus, exactly $$$2n$$$ cannons       were placed.</p>          <center> <img class="tex-graphics" src="https://espresso.codeforces.com/5c881cddb6835c9ccbae4d64339c61ee89ca98e6.png" style="max-width: 100.0%;max-height: 100.0%;" />         <span class="tex-font-size-small">Initial polygon for       $$$n=4$$$.</span> </center>          <p>Cannons shoot character <span class="tex-font-style-tt">1</span>.       At any moment of time, no more than one cannon is shooting. When a         <span class="tex-font-style-tt">1</span> flies out of a cannon,       it flies forward (in the direction of the shot) until it collides       with a polygon border or another <span class="tex-font-style-tt">1</span>. After that, it takes the cell       in which it was before the collision and remains there. Take a       look at the examples for better understanding.</p>     <p>More formally: </p>     <ul> <li> if a cannon stands in the row $$$i$$$, to the left of the         first column, and shoots with a <span class="tex-font-style-tt">1</span>, then the <span class="tex-font-style-tt">1</span> starts its flight from the         cell ($$$i, 1$$$) and ends in some cell ($$$i, j$$$); </li>       <li> if a cannon stands in the column $$$j$$$, above the first         row, and shoots with a <span class="tex-font-style-tt">1</span>,         then the <span class="tex-font-style-tt">1</span> starts its         flight from the cell ($$$1, j$$$) and ends in some cell ($$$i,         j$$$). </li></ul>          <p>For example, consider the following sequence of shots:</p>          <center> <img class="tex-graphics" src="https://espresso.codeforces.com/477656491c995331732d67143a59e43b21075bcc.png" style="max-width: 100.0%;max-height: 100.0%;" />        <p> <span class="tex-font-size-small">1. Shoot the cannon in the           row $$$2$$$.                         2. Shoot the cannon in           the row $$$2$$$.                         3. Shoot the cannon           in column $$$3$$$.</span> </p></center>          <p>You have a report from the military training on your desk. This       report is a square matrix with side length $$$n$$$ consisting of         <span class="tex-font-style-tt">0</span> and <span class="tex-font-style-tt">1</span>. You wonder if the training       actually happened. In other words, is there a sequence of shots       such that, after the training, you get the given matrix?</p>     <p>Each cannon can make an arbitrary number of shots.
